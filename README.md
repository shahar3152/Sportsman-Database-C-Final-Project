## Sportsman Database – Final Project in C

This project implements a **data management system in C** for handling information about athletes and the sports events they participate in.

### 🔹 Main Features
- Reading athlete and event data from text files (`SportsmanData.txt` and `EventData.txt`).
- Building dynamic arrays and linked data structures to represent athletes and their events.
- Adding new athletes and events via user input, with validation to prevent duplicates.
- Generating reports and saving all updated information back to files.
- Menu-based interface for convenient navigation through all operations.

### 🔹 Technical Highlights
- Use of dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `realloc`, `free`).
- File handling with error checking.
- Structured programming and modular design.
- Comprehensive function documentation before each function.
- Implementation of helper functions such as `countLines`, `Sportsman2FromFile`, and `Events2FromFile`.

### 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
- Working with dynamic data structures in C.
- Managing data persistence through file I/O.
- Applying good programming practices like modularity and documentation.
